                    <p>
                        snyprr.ai uses <strong className="text-[var(--text-primary)]">AI-assisted analysis</strong> to generate market signals, price zone calculations, and risk/reward assessments.
                        Our proprietary models analyse real-time market data, technical indicators, and historical patterns to produce the signals you see on the platform.
